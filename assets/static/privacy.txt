Liquio sends the URL of every website that you visit to our servers. It does this to retrieve the list of annotations for a specific webpage. We store a log of those URLs with a timestamp, which means we can see when someone opens a specific webpage. We have specifically configured our webserver not to log any identifiable information such as IP address or which browser you are using. This means we cannot associate browsing activity with a specific person. We only use this information to monitor traffic and fix bugs. We don't share this information with anyone.
