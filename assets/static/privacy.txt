To get annotations for a specific webpage Liquio sends the URL of every website that you visit to our servers. This means we can see which websites someone opens. We do not purposefully send any identifiable information to our servers. We have also explicitly configured our server to not store any identifiable information such an IP address or which browser you are using. We only use this information to monitor traffic and fix bugs. We never share this information with anyone.
