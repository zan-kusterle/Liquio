Liquio sends the URL of every website that you visit to our servers. It does this to retrieve the list of annotations for a specific webpage. Because of that we can see the URLs that you visit while using this extension. We do not store any identifiable information such as IP addresses or which browser you are using. We only use this information to monitor traffic and fix bugs. We never share this information with anyone.
