            The content should be relevant to your product and users. When people are able to read the content, they will give you feedback about the copy and how they feel about it. This will push you to reflect on the type of messages you communicate and the tone of voice that makes people trust your platform.
            Sometimes people you are testing with will bring up questions that you haven’t even thought about. They will give you examples of similar things they use that might help you in your design. With Lorem Ipsum, you won’t get any of that.
