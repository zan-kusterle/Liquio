# Trust Metrics

In it's essence, a trust metric provides whitelist of users whose votes are counted in the final result. Everyone can choose their own trust metric and anyone can create new trust metric. By default a trust metric that uses Advogato algorithm is used.

# Delegations

Every user has one unit of voting power by default. Users can then delegate their voting power to other users. It's possible to delegate only for certain topics (e.g. politics, science). It's also possible to delegate different amounts of your voting power to different users.

# Polls

Polls can be created by anyone, but what ultimately decides it's relevance is how many people vote on it. Each poll has a title which should be as unambiguous as possible to avoid confusion among voters. There are two types of polls. Probability polls are used when voters should decide whether something is true or false. Quantity polls are used when voters should decide what the value of something is (e.g. Age of the universe in years).
